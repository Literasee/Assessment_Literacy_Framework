## Assessment Literacy
### Collaborative Group Work
##### Jeri Thompson, Charlie DePascale, Chris Domaleski
##### & Damian Betebenner

## Overview

- What problem or issue did your group work to address?   
- What was your group’s approach to addressing the issue?

===

## Two Central Issues

1. The need for educators (teachers, administrators, central office) and policymakers to have an understanding of assessments:
 - Classroom assessments vs. high-stakes tests
 - Purpose of assessments
 - Use of results of the assessments (classroom or beyond)

2. Dissemination of assessment literacy information for various stakeholders.

===

Our group attempted to marry these two issues by creating a lasting, publicly available resource to facilitate the creation,
collaboration, and communication of assessment literacy content.


===

## Areas of Focus

- Defining Assessment Literacy
- Examples of resources and approaches designed to improve assessment literacy
- Building and sustaining assessment literacy over the long term

===

### Create • Collaborate • Communicate

- We set out to create a framework and some content that links to selected elements of the framework
- We also worked to develop a resource to help create, collaborate on and communicate the content
- We view this as a _proof of concept_ to show how we can utilize these tools moving forward to more effectively promote assessment literacy

## Defining Assessment Literacy

- Improving assessment literacy implies a shared understanding of the meaning of assessment literacy.
- No consensus definition on what assessment literacy is.


===

> Assessment literacy consists of an individual’s understandings of the fundamental assessment concepts and procedures deemed
> likely to influence educational decisions. (Popham, 2012)


===

> Assessment literacy is the set of beliefs and knowledge and practices about assessment that lead a teacher to use
> assessment to improve student learning and achievement. (Michigan Assessment Consortium)

## The Context for Assessment Literacy

- Assessment literacy is context dependent.
- We consider three broad categories:
    - Teachers
    - Administrators
    - Policymakers

## Improving Assessment Literacy

Several aspects that all educators should know in order to be assessment literate.

- Educators need to understand the role of assessments and be knowledgeable consumers of assessment information.
- Educators need to be constructors of high-quality assessments and scoring guides.
- Educators need to be able to interpret and use the results of students’ performances.


===

## The Role of Assessments and Assessment Information
### Four key principles

1. The results of assessments should be beneficial for students.
2. The content of the assessments should allow students to demonstrate progress toward important learning goals and be aligned with the subject matter.
3. The selected assessments should fit the identified purpose.
4. A variety of assessment types should be utilized to measure student achievement.


===

## Sustaining and Evaluating Assessment Literacy

1. Relevant Focus
2. Support Structures
3. Widespread Investment and Agency
4. Ongoing Monitoring and Review
