## Overview

- What problem or issue did your group work to address?   
- What was your group’s approach to addressing the issue?

===

## Two Central Issues

1. The need for educators (teachers, administrators, central office) and policymakers to have an understanding of assessments:
 - Classroom assessments vs. high-stakes tests
 - Purpose of assessments
 - Use of results of the assessments (classroom or beyond)

2. Dissemination of assessment literacy information for various stakeholders.

===

Our group attempted to marry these two issues by creating a lasting, publicly available resource to facilitate creation,
collaboration, and communication of assessment literacy content.


===

## Areas of Focus

- Defining Assessment Literacy
- Examples of resources and approaches designed to improve assessment literacy
- Building and sustaining assessment literacy over the long term

===

### Create • Collaborate • Communicate

- We set out to create a framework and some content that links to selected elements of the framework
- We also worked to develop a resource to help create, collaborate on and communicate the content
- We view this as a _proof of concept_ to show how we can utilize these tools moving forward to more effectively promote assessment literacy
