### A Framework for Improving Assessment Literacy

According to National Council on Teacher Quality (2015), teacher education “preparation programs are not delivering new teachers with needed skills, forcing districts to dedicate professional development dollars to accomplish what they believe higher education should have done in the first place.”  In the Council’s review of 690 teacher education programs, only 24% adequately train teachers how to assess learning and use student performance data to inform instruction and these concepts are embedded in methods classes.   However, none of the programs reviewed offered a data literacy course.  What does this mean?  Pre-service teachers do not have opportunities to wrestle with understanding the data derived from assessments nor to thoroughly understand how to use the data to plan instruction.  These results are after the 2010, NCATE, the largest accreditor of teacher preparation programs, report recommended that “candidates be presented with multiple and rich course material in their preparation that will enable them to become assessment-literate and data-wise.” It did not however, provide specific suggestions as to how this new information could be integrated into existing coursework or provided through new coursework. Despite their current lack of training, classroom teachers report spending as much as one-third to one-half of their time involved in assessment-related activities, whether preparing, administering, or reviewing assessments in order to determine how to make instructional changes (Stiggins, 1992).
In order to compensate for the lack of assessment literacy training in teacher preparation programs, districts attempt to fill this gap through various structures and opportunities such as required professional development, common planning time, or through professional learning communities in which educators meet periodically over an extended period of time to focus on specific topics.  Although these structures and opportunities could assist educators in collaborating when looking at assessment data or analyzing student work, even groups of teachers are at a disadvantage as there is a lack of clarity in what they are looking for and knowing what to do with the information they find. In many cases professional development is simply a statutory requirement and does not necessarily sustain a focus on assessments and data use (William, p. 28).
Coupled with the insufficient understanding of assessment literacy is the controversial belief that schools are over testing students.  Consequently educators are left with the belief that 1) all assessments are tests, 2) an uncertainty as to which assessments should be administered, and 3) the uncertainty about the meaning of the results of the assessments they do administer.  A clear understanding of the critical role that assessments play in the classroom, as well as understanding how assessment data can be used by a variety of different audiences, can assist educators in making decisions about which assessments to select to best serve their instructional needs. 
In this paper, we attempt to lay out a framework that will help to develop that clear understanding among teachers, administrators, policymakers and those who are responsible for a) developing instructional materials to improve assessment literacy, b) providing assessment resources to educators, and c) providing pre-service training and in-service professional development related to assessment literacy.  The paper is divided into three main sections. In the first section, we develop a definition of assessment literacy.  In the second section, we provide examples of resources and approaches designed to improve assessment literacy.  In the final section of the paper, we discuss what is needed to build and sustain assessment literacy over the long term.
Defining Assessment Literacy
A prerequisite to improving assessment literacy is a shared understanding of the meaning of assessment literacy; not only an understating of the content which assessment literacy comprises, but an understanding also of the larger knowledge base which the term assessment literate entails.  When asked to define assessment literacy, there is a natural tendency to begin to list specific assessment-related knowledge, understanding, and skills that an assessment literate educator must possess.  This could be a straightforward list of topics and concepts such as the following selected topics from Michigan Assessment Consortium (MAC) Assessment Literacy Standards for Teachers:
-	There are different purposes for student assessment
-	A non-technical understanding statistical concepts associated with assessment:
o	Reliability
o	Validity, a characteristic of the use of the assessment, not the assessment itself
-	Use a variety of protocols for looking at and scoring student work
-	Use assessment results to make appropriate instructional decisions for individual students and groups of students.
-	Use assessment results appropriately to modify instruction to improve student achievement.
Alternatively, the list could be expanded to include more detail as was done by Popham (2012) with corresponding items selected from a list of potential assessment literacy topics for educators:
-	The fundamental function of educational assessment – namely the collection of evidence from which inferences can be made about students’ covert skills, knowledge, and affect.
-	Reliability of educational assessments, especially the three ways in which consistency evidence is reported for groups of test-takers (stability, alternate-form reliability, and internal consistency) and how to gauge the consistency of assessment for individual test takers.
-	The prominent role three types of validity evidence (content-related, criterion-related, and construct-related evidence) should play in building arguments to support the accuracy of test-based interpretations.
-	Scoring of students’ responses to constructed-response test items, especially the distinctive contribution made by well-formed rubrics.
-	Designing and implementing formative assessment procedures consonant with both research evidence and experience-based insights about the likely success of such procedures.
-	How to determine the appropriateness of an accountability test for use in evaluating the quality of instruction.
Regardless of the level of detail included, lists of topics are only the starting point in defining assessment literacy.
Popham (2012) offers an elegant definition of assessment literacy:  Assessment literacy consists of an individual’s understandings of the fundamental assessment concepts and procedures deemed likely to influence educational decisions. What makes Popham’s definition elegant is that it does not divorce understanding of assessment concepts and procedures from the context in which they will be used; that is, to influence educational decisions.  Many people reading that definition will focus on the words “understandings of the fundamental assessment concepts and procedures” as the critical aspects to identify an assessment literate person.  However, the second half of the definition, “deemed likely to influence educational decisions,” is equally important.  Assessment literacy includes not only an understanding of assessment concepts and procedures, but also the proficiency to apply those concepts and procedures to influence educational decisions within a particular context as a teacher, administrator, or policymaker (or student, parent, taxpayer, …).  
Compare Popham’s definition to the definition of assessment literacy contained within the Assessment Literacy Standards developed by the Michigan Assessment Consortium (MAC):
“Assessment literacy is the set of beliefs and knowledge and practices about assessment that lead a teacher  to use assessment to improve student learning and achievement.”  
The MAC definition brings another dimension to the concept of assessment literacy: disposition.  Central to the MAC concept of assessment literacy is the idea that not only does the teacher possess the requisite knowledge and skills to use assessment effectively to improve student learning, but also has the inclination and tendency to do so. On the surface, disposition may not seem central to the definition of literacy or a literate person.  When focused on outcomes (i.e., improved instruction and student learning), however, there can be little argument about the importance of dispositions and the appropriateness of including them in the definition of assessment literacy.  It is not enough to simply understand that not smoking, a proper diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and physical activity are core components of a heart-healthy lifestyle.  It is not enough simply to know that establishing a personal budget, saving and investing wisely, and not accumulating large amounts of credit card debt are core components of financial wellness.  Similarly, understanding assessment concepts and procedures and their role in instruction will not lead to improved instruction and student learning without the disposition to apply that knowledge and skills.
As a starting point to defining assessment literacy, therefore, we began with the fundamental concept of literacy; that is, the possession of basic knowledge and skills (e.g., the ability to read and write).  We then moved from literacy to the notion of a person being literate in a particular area, a concept which includes the knowing of how and when to apply that basic knowledge and skills appropriately within a particular concept.  Finally, we completed the definition with the MAC requirement that an assessment literate educator not only possess an understanding of fundamental assessment concepts and procedures and know how to use them within their specific context, but also have the disposition to use that knowledge and skills to improve instruction and student learning.
Working from that definition, in the following sections, we will discuss context in more detail and suggest an assessment literacy framework to guide the development of assessment literate educators.  
Defining context for teachers, administrators, and policymakers
If assessment literacy is context dependent, then it follows that one must understand the context in which an educator is functioning to begin to understand what is needed to be assessment literate within that particular context.  In this section, we address context for three board categories of educators: teachers, administrators, and policymakers.    Of course, there will be variation in context within those three broad categories.  There are certainly differences among the teaching contexts and assessment literacy needs of an elementary school teacher, a middle school science specialist, and a high school special educator.  There will also variation within the broad class of administrators that might include building level principals, district curriculum directors, and superintendents.  However, there are enough similarities within each of the three categories and enough significant differences across the three categories to illustrate the importance of context in defining and determining how best to improve assessment literacy.  Of course, there are additional stakeholders who could also be considered such as students, parents, and the general public.  Their context for the interpretation and use of assessment is different from that of teachers, administrators, and policymakers.  At this time, however, those groups are beyond the scope of our discussion.
Teachers
For teachers, assessment involves gathering and interpreting evidence to inform instructional decisions to improve instruction and learning for individual students.  As suggested in the MAC standards, quality assessments are a critical attribute of effective teaching. It can be argued that at the classroom level assessment and instruction must be tightly interwoven to have the most positive impact on student learning. Therefore, it is logical to identify instruction as the primary context for assessment literacy for teachers.  
As suggested in the figure below, it is also logical to establish a dependent link between assessment literacy and instructional literacy.  That is, the upper bound of teachers’ assessment literacy will always be impacted by their instructional literacy.  If we accept that the definition of an assessment literate teacher includes the capacity to use the information gathered from student assessment, limitations in instructional literacy must be place a cap on the extent to which that teacher can be considered assessment literate .
