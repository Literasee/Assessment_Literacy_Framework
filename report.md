Sustaining and Evaluating Assessment Literacy 

In the final section of this paper will we discuss recommendations for sustaining and evaluating assessment literacy initiatives.   We argue that literacy efforts are most likely to be sustained and successful when characterized by four factors:
1.	Relevant Focus: Literacy initiatives are thoughtfully designed to be meaningful and useful for a variety of practitioners 
2.	Support Structures:  There are well defined mechanisms to provide the appropriate resources to support literacy initiatives   
3.	Widespread Investment and Agency:   There is buy-in from a variety of stakeholders at multiple levels, who are equipped and empowered to maintain and expand initiatives  
4.	Ongoing Monitoring and Review:  Any worthwhile initiative must be regularly monitored and evaluated to foster ongoing improvement
These factors are neither linear nor mutually exclusive.  A thoughtful strategy to sustain and support literacy involves continuing and often concurrent attention to each element.  Because these factors are closely related, we expect that efforts to support  any one element, will positively impact all others.    Conversely, inattention to any one factor may broadly threaten sustainability of the entire enterprise.
Relevant Focus

As discussed in previous sections, literacy is multifaceted.  Our framework emphasizes that different users need different information for different purposes.    If educators and leaders see literacy initiatives as disconnected from their work, it is unlikely to encourage the support necessary to sustain it.   Too often assessment literacy is regarded as a “psychometric exotica” that is unrelated to everyday decisions of educators (Popham, 2006).  To create sustainable and effective literacy programs, substantial up-front effort is essential to insure the focus is relevant. 
We believe our framework can be useful to help determine and prioritize the literacy topics that are most critical.  This starts by soliciting feedback form a variety of stakeholders about the skills that are most essential to their success.  Rather than focusing exclusively on what stakeholders want to know, it is vital to solicit feedback about what they want to do.  That is, how do stakeholders want to use assessment information to support prioritized their goals. Potential questions to ask may include:
-	What questions do you want to answer with information about student achievement?
-	In what ways do you want to use data to inform decisions about individual students, practices, and/or policies?   
-	What information do you typically use to support these decisions? What are the strengths and limitations of your current practices? 
-	What outcomes are most important to promote?
We propose a focus on purposes and uses to hone-in on the information and practices that are likely to be most relevant to various users.  Consider, for example, that the assessment literacy needs for elementary teacher working to understand and promote progress in English proficiency for young language learners, is likely very different from the literacy needs of a high-school math department head seeking to evaluate the effectiveness of her school’s college-preparatory curriculum.   To the extent the literacy initiative is tailored to meet the needs of a broad range of practitioners, it is much more likely to be supported and sustained. 
This focus on relevance can be supported by ‘traditional’ data collection approaches such as surveys or focus-groups.   To be most effective, however, these mechanisms should elicit responses about desired purposes and uses and facilitate association of responses to the respondent’s roles and responsibilities.  In this manner, implementation of sustainable literacy initiatives will be supported by a better understanding of topics that are likely to be relevant and useful. 
Support Structures

Support structures refer to the range of requirements necessary to operationalize and sustain a high-quality literacy initiative.   We associate requirements with one of two categories for the sake of presentation: organizational support and implementation resources.  
Organizational support primarily refers to the personnel and policy requirements that accompany a thoughtful plan to implement and sustain the assessment literacy initiative.  It starts with having personnel who are explicitly charged with design and oversight.  These personnel should have sufficient authority to carry-out the plan and secure the resources necessary to implement it.  Ideally, at each important level in an organizational structure (e.g. district, complex, school), there will be one or more persons with the authority and responsibility for implementation.  As we will discuss later in this section, broad-based ‘bottom-up’ empowerment is critical as well, but it will likely be most effective if the assessment literacy initiative is clearly supported from the ‘top-down.’ 
Organizational leadership should also provide the policies and clarity of expectations necessary to support the success of assessment literacy.  Siggins (1995) asserts, “the key planning question is: What policies will need to be changed or added to our district’s policy manual to support a positive assessment and learning environment.”    Such policies may involve requiring pre-service or in-service training, encumbering time and resources for planning and development, or adding specific demonstrations to educator performance criteria.
